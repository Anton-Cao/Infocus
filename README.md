# Infocus

Infocus is a Chrome extension that tries to keep you *productive* while you're on the internet because everyone wants to be *productiveee*. You can input sites that you find distracting (eg. YouTube, Facebook) and Infocus will automagically stop you from visiting these websites by either going back to the previous page, or closing the tab entirely if you instinctively type `ctrl+t "you" enter` like me. 

Plus, if you really need to disable it, you'll get some mental math practice in the process!
